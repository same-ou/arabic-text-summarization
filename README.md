# arabic-text-summarization

This Streamlit application utilizes a fine-tuned version of a set of summarization models specifically designed for Arabic text. The models are fine-tuned on the [XL-Sum dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/csebuetnlp/xlsum). Users can either input text directly or upload a PDF for summarization.
